- Support basic operations of CSV parser, including:
  + read file
  + write file
  + get item from file
  + add item to file
  + remove item from file
  + update existing item in file
  + check if item exists or not
  + clear file

- Auto create an empty CSV file if not exist

ADVANTAGES:
- Support maximized OOP by using objects instead of string dicts
- Allow inheritance

NOTES:
- In .CSV file, header items must contain no space between. For example:
    + VALID: id|name|address
    + INVALID: id|name| address

LIMITATIONS:
- To be able to work, CSV root object must has item called "id" as its unique identifier
- Doesn't work with Vietnamese characters

TODOS:
- Support file lock in multi-threads
