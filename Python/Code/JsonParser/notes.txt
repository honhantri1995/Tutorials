- Support basic operations of JSON parser, including:
  + read file
  + write file
  + get item from file
  + add item to file
  + remove item from file
  + update existing item in file
  + check if item exists or not
  + clear file

- Support file lock in multi-threads

- Auto create an empty JSON file if not exist

ADVANTAGES:
- Support maximized OOP by using objects instead of string dicts
- Allow inheritance

NOTES:
- Design and implement for JSON files used for database purpose. Not very suitable for JSON files used for configuration purpose.

LIMITATIONS:
- To be able to work, JSON root object must has item called "id" as its unique identifier
