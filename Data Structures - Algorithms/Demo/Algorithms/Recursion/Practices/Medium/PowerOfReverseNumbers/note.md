[Medium] Power Of Reverse Numbers

## Problem
Given a number n, find the value of n raised to the power of its own reverse.
Note: The result will always fit into a 32-bit signed integer.

Examples:
Input	Output	Explanation
n = 2	4	    The reverse of 2 is 2, and 2^2 = 4.
n = 10	10	    The reverse of 10 is 1 (leading zero is discarded), and 10^1 = 10.
n = 3	27	    The reverse of 3 is 3, and 3^3 = 27.

Constraints:
1 <= n <= 10
