## Problem
Write a function that calculates the n-th Fibonacci number using the following constraints:
- If n is less than 0, return -1.
- If n is 0, return 0.
- If n is 1, return 1.
- For n greater than 1, use an iterative approach to calculate the Fibonacci number.

Example:
- Input: n = 6
- Output: 8 (the Fibonacci sequence is 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8 ...)

Time complexity: O(2^n)
Space complexity: O(n)
