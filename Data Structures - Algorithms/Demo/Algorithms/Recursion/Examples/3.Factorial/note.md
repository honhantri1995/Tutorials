## Problem:
Write a function that calculates the factorial of a non-negative integer n using the following constraints:
- If n is less than 0, return -1 (indicating an invalid input).
- If n is 0, return 1 (by definition).
- For n greater than 0, use a recursive approach to calculate the factorial.
Example:
- Input: n = 5
- Output: 120 (Since 5! = 5×4×3×2×1 = 120)

Time complexity: O(n)
